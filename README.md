# Bathymetry
Simple code to read a .nc file and plot bathymetric datas
The .nc file is from the SHOM website (french navy datas) and is about the french Mediterranean.

The first and most important thing to do is to know the names of the variables in your file. 
To do this, use the command ncdisp('yourfile.nc'), and then you can call them and use them.
